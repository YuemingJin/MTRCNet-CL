**Participated Challenge:**
<br/>
We recently employed our method to participate the [MICCAI'2019 Surgical Workflow and Skill Analysis Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18824884/wiki/), and achieved compelling results:
[Winner](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18824884/wiki/599131) of Phase Recognition Task & 
[Runner-up](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18824884/wiki/599131) of Tool Presence Detection Task

* The implementation is based on Pytorch 0.4.0
